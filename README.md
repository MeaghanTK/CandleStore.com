# Candle Store

Welcome to Candle Store! This is an online shop for candles inspired by Baldur's Gate 3. Users can browse products, manage their cart, and handle registration and login.
Some of this code has been used in my previous coding, namely my online-store for dice. Evidently, I like DnD too much and I liked my layout I had there.
